# Stripe Payment Integration

This document describes the Stripe payment integration implemented in the ride-sharing application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Payment Flow
- Users can make payments during their ride using Stripe
- Payment status is tracked and stored in the database
- Captains can only finish rides after payment is completed

### 2. Backend Implementation

#### New Routes (`/payments`)
- `POST /payments/create-payment-intent` - Creates a Stripe payment intent
- `POST /payments/confirm-payment` - Confirms payment completion
- `GET /payments/payment-status/:rideId` - Checks payment status

#### Database Changes
- Added `paymentStatus` field to the ride model
- Added `paymentId` field to store Stripe payment intent ID

#### Ride Controller Updates
- Modified `endRide` to check payment status before allowing ride completion
- Returns error if payment is not completed

### 3. Frontend Implementation

#### New Components
- `PaymentModal.jsx` - Handles Stripe payment flow
- `Notification.jsx` - Displays success/error messages

#### Updated Components
- `Riding.jsx` - Integrated payment modal and status tracking
- `FinishRide.jsx` - Added payment status check with alert modal

## Payment Flow

1. **User clicks "Make Payment"** in Riding.jsx
2. **Payment modal opens** with ride details
3. **Stripe payment intent is created** on backend
4. **Payment is processed** using Stripe test card
5. **Payment is confirmed** and status updated in database
6. **Captain can finish ride** only after payment completion
7. **Alert shows** if captain tries to finish ride without payment

## Test Cards

For testing, use these Stripe test cards:
- **Success**: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- **Declined**: 4000 0000 0000 0002
- **Insufficient funds**: 4000 0000 0000 9995

## Dependencies

### Backend
- `stripe: ^14.28.0`

### Frontend
- `@stripe/stripe-js: ^3.15.0`

## Security Notes

1. **Never expose secret keys** in frontend code
2. **Always validate payment** on backend before confirming
3. **Use webhooks** in production for payment confirmation
4. **Implement proper error handling** for failed payments
5. **Add payment retry logic** for better user experience

## Production Considerations

1. **Replace test keys** with live Stripe keys
2. **Implement webhook handling** for payment confirmation
3. **Add payment retry mechanisms**
4. **Implement proper card collection** using Stripe Elements
5. **Add payment analytics** and monitoring
6. **Implement refund functionality**
7. **Add payment dispute handling**
